        <h3>Heap Sort Algorithm</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in computer programming. Learning how to write the heap sort algorithm requires knowledge of two types of data structures - arrays and trees.
            The initial set of numbers that we want to sort is stored in an array e.g. [10, 3, 76, 34, 23, 32] and after sorting, we get a sorted array [3,10,23,32,34,76].
            Heap sort works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of complete binary tree called a heap.

        What is Heap Data Structure?
        Heap is a special tree-based data structure. A binary tree is said to follow a heap data structure if
        it is a complete binary tree
        All nodes in the tree follow the property that they are greater than their children i.e. the largest element is at the root and both its children and smaller than the root and so on. Such a heap is called a max-heap. If instead, all nodes are smaller than their children, it is called a min-heap
        The following example diagram shows Max-Heap and Min-Heap.

        How to "heapify" a tree
        Starting from a complete binary tree, we can modify it to become a Max-Heap by running a function called heapify on all the non-leaf elements of the heap.
        Since heapify uses recursion, it can be difficult to grasp. So let's first think about how you would heapify a tree with just three elements.
        The example above shows two scenarios - one in which the root is the largest element and we don't need to do anything. And another in which the root had a larger element as a child and we needed to swap to maintain max-heap property.
        If you're worked with recursive algorithms before, you've probably identified that this must be the base case.
        Now let's think of another scenario in which there is more than one level.

        The top element isn't a max-heap but all the sub-trees are max-heaps.
        To maintain the max-heap property for the entire tree, we will have to keep pushing 2 downwards until it reaches its correct position.
